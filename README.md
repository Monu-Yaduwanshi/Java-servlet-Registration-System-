# Java Servlet Registration System

This project is a simple Registration System developed using Java Servlets, designed to capture user registration data and store it in a MySQL database. The application utilizes Apache Tomcat as the servlet container and is developed in Eclipse IDE.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register by providing their name, branch, semester, gender, hobbies, username, and password.
- **Data Storage**: Registration details are stored in a MySQL database for future retrieval.
- **Responsive Feedback**: The system provides feedback to users on successful registration or failure.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language for developing the application.
- **Jakarta Servlet**: Used for creating the servlet-based web application.
- **MySQL**: Used as the database management system to store user registration data.
- **Apache Tomcat**: Serves as the web server to run the Java Servlets.
- **Eclipse IDE**: The development environment used to build the project.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure that JDK is installed on your machine.
- **MySQL Server**: Ensure that MySQL Server is running and accessible.
- **Apache Tomcat**: Download and set up Apache Tomcat.
- **Eclipse IDE**: Download and install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.

### Database Configuration

1. **Create a MySQL Database**:
   - Create a database named `registrationdata`.
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE registrationdata;
Create a Student Table:
Create a student table with the following columns:
CREATE TABLE student (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    branch VARCHAR(50),
    semester INT,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    hobbies VARCHAR(255),
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(100)
);
